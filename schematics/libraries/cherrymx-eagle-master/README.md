#### a basic eagle library for cherry mx keyswitches

I created this repository for this eagle library after recieving a number of messages from people who found mention of it in google results and inquired to me for a copy. I'm happy (even eager) to share my work with others who can make use of it.

<del>However, despite creating this library, I as of yet haven't tested it on a real PCB. I have done my best to verify it by printing it out and even laser cutting it into plastic to check alignment, but have not had the chance to test with a PCB. For that reason, if you do use it on a PCB, PLEASE contact me to let me know everything came OK.</del> Also, if you modify or expand the library, please contribute your work back to this repository so that others can benefit.

*Update*: As of January 2014 the library has been verified to work on an actual PCB.  Specifically, it has been tested with MX1A-11NW switches.  You will definitely want a part ending in "W" ("With pins") if the switches will be PCB mounted. (Thanks [daveho](https://github.com/daveho)!)
